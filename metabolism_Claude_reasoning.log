## Summary - Iteration 1

**Baseline Analysis:**
- stoichiometry_R2: 0.037 (very poor recovery)
- test_pearson: 0.205
- All regularization was disabled (coefficients = 0)

**Changes for Iteration 1:**
- `coeff_S_L1`: 0 → 0.001 (sparsity regularization)
- `coeff_S_integer`: 0 → 0.001 (integer penalty)
- `coeff_mass_conservation`: 0 → 0.001 (mass balance constraint)

**Rationale:** The stoichiometric matrix S has known structure:
1. ~96% of entries are zero (sparse)
2. Non-zero entries are integers {-2,-1,+1,+2}
3. Column sums should be zero (mass conservation)

Adding regularization encodes this prior knowledge, which should help the model recover the true structure rather than arbitrary continuous values that happen to fit the dynamics.
