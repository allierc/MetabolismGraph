## Context

MetabolismGraph sits at the intersection of several active research areas: graph neural networks for physical and biological systems, inverse problems in systems biology, neural differential equations, and LLM-driven scientific exploration. The framework uses message-passing GNNs on bipartite metabolite-reaction graphs to solve the inverse problem of recovering kinetic parameters from concentration dynamics, with an LLM-based closed-loop exploration engine for hyperparameter optimization.

Below we collect key references organized by topic. Where available, we provide arXiv or DOI links.

## Symbolic Regression for Network Dynamics

6. **Yu, Z., Ding, J., & Li, Y.** (2025). *Discovering network dynamics with neural symbolic regression.* Nature Computational Science.
   [DOI:10.1038/s43588-025-00893-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-025-00893-8)
   — ND2: neural symbolic regression that discovers governing equations of network dynamics directly from data. Applied to gene regulatory networks, the method corrects the classical Hill equation model by replacing per-neighbor nonlinear terms with a logistic function applied to the aggregate neighbor sum (see comparison below).

### Comparison with MetabolismGraph

Yu et al.'s corrected gene regulation model (their Eq. 2) and MetabolismGraph share the same general ODE structure — self-dynamics plus interaction dynamics — but differ in how neighbor contributions are aggregated:

**Yu et al. — Gene regulation (ND2 corrected):**

$$\frac{dx_i}{dt} = \underbrace{s_i - \gamma_i x_i}_{\text{self-dynamics}} + \underbrace{\beta \, \tilde{S}\!\left(\sum_j A_{ij}\, x_j\right)}_{\text{interaction}}$$

where $\tilde{S}(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1}$ is the logistic function. The nonlinearity acts on the **sum** of weighted neighbor states — no per-edge rate constants, no multiplicative aggregation.

**MetabolismGraph — Metabolic kinetics:**

$$\frac{dc_i}{dt} = \underbrace{-\lambda_i(c_i - c_i^{\text{baseline}})}_{\text{self-dynamics}} + \underbrace{\sum_j S_{ij} \cdot k_j \cdot \prod_{k \in \text{sub}(j)} c_k^{s_{kj}}}_{\text{interaction}}$$

**Key differences:**

| | Yu et al. (gene regulation) | MetabolismGraph (metabolism) |
|---|---|---|
| Graph | Monopartite (gene → gene) | Bipartite (metabolite ↔ reaction) |
| Aggregation | $\tilde{S}(\sum_j A_{ij} x_j)$ — logistic of sum | $\sum_j S_{ij} k_j \prod_k c_k^{s_{kj}}$ — sum of products |
| Rate constants | Single global $\beta$ | Per-reaction $k_j$ (256 parameters) |
| Nonlinearity | Bounded logistic $\tilde{S} \in [0,1]$ | Unbounded power law $c^s$ |
| Higher-order | Implicit: $\partial \dot{x}_i / \partial x_j$ depends on all neighbors via $\tilde{S}$ | Explicit: mass-action products couple substrates within each reaction |

The gene regulation model has **no per-reaction aggregation step** — it sums all neighbor states into a single scalar, then applies a saturating nonlinearity. MetabolismGraph instead computes a separate rate for each reaction (multiplicative aggregation of substrate concentrations), then sums the stoichiometric contributions. This reflects a fundamental difference between gene regulation (bounded transcriptional response) and metabolism (unbounded mass-action kinetics).

   — Chronic jugular microdialysis paired with LC-MS measures ~123 bloodborne compounds at 7.5-min cadence in freely moving mice.
